= What You Will Build

This document describes the steps to create a JaCaMo Package from scratch. A *JaCaMo Package* is a set of development artifacts (agent code, artifact classes, organisation specifications, …) that can be reused by other projects. 

The package being developed along this document is very simple: a hello world package that includes:

- an _artifact_, and
- a library of agent _plans_.

The artifact is used to display a message in a GUI as shown below. The library has just one plan that an agent can use to create and show messages on this artifact.

NOTE: if you want to transform an existing  JaCaMo project into a package, see xref:./based-on-existing-project.adoc[this doc] after reading this one.

= What You Need

* Java 17 or newer
* A shell terminal
* A text editor (Visual Studio Code, Notepad, ...)
* GitHub account where the package will be published


= JaCaMo package development


1. Create a new project called `jcm-hello` into your GitHub account. Since my user name is `jomifred`, in the sequence, replace it by your user name.  

1. Clone the project:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/jomifred/jcm-hello.git
----

1. Create a new JaCaMo application placing the files in the directory of the local copy of the GitHub repository:
+
----
wget -q http://jacamo-lang.github.io/jacamo/nps/npss.zip
unzip npss.zip
./gradlew -Dexec.args="jcm-hello --console" --refresh-dependencies
----

1. Add files on Git
+
----
cd jcm-hello
git add gradle* log* build.gradle
----

1. Create the an artifact to show messages in a GUI
+
Download the code of the artifact fom link:./GridDisplay.java[here] and place it at `src/env/display`. The following commands do that:
+
----
cd src/env
rm -rf example
mkdir display
cd display
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo/packages/docs/devs/creating-packages/GridDisplay.java
cd ../../..
----

1. Create a library of agent plans
+
We have a single plans in our library, download it fom link:./hello-grid.asl[here] and place it in file `src/agt/hello.asl`. The following commands do that:
+
----
cd src/agt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo/packages/docs/devs/creating-packages/hello-grid.asl
cd ../..
----
+
The plan of this library can be used to achieve the goal `print_hello`. If selected for execution, it creates and uses the artifact of this package.

1. Test the library by changing `src/agt/sample_agent.asl` to
+
-----
!start.
+!start <- !print_hello.

{ include("hello-grid.asl") }
{ include("$jacamo/templates/common-cartago.asl") }
-----
+
and `jcm-hello.jcm` to
+
----
mas jcm_hello {
    agent bob: sample_agent.asl    
}
----
+
and then running with
+
----
./gradlew
----
+
You should see a GUI screen printing the hello world message.

1. Add new files into Git
+
----
git add src *jcm
----

= Publication on GitHub

To publish the package on GitHub, edit the file `build.gradle` changing the group attribute following your GitHub  account:

----
group = 'com.github.jomifred'
----

Commit changes and create a tag with the package version:

----
git add build.gradle jcm_hello.jcm 
git commit -m "first version of package hello"
git tag -a 1.0 -m "version 1.0"
----

Push changes:

----
git push --follow-tags
----

Then go to your GitHub account and create a *release* (named `1.0` based on tag `1.0`).

= Using the package

Create a new JaCaMo application:

----
wget -q http://jacamo-lang.github.io/jacamo/nps/npss.zip
unzip npss.zip
./gradlew -Dexec.args="test-hello --console"
----

Add the JaCaMo new package in `build.gradle` including the following dependency (remember to replace the user name):

----
implementation('com.github.jomifred:jcm-hello:1.0')    
----

Edit `test-hello.jcm` creating a package *alias* (so that we can use `hello` to refer to the new package):

----
mas test_hello {

    agent bob: sample_agent.asl

    uses package: hello "com.github.jomifred:jcm-hello:1.0"

}

----

Change `sample_agent.asl` to include the plan of the package and to use it:

----
{ include("$hello/agt/hello-grid.asl") } // *** include plans from the package

!start.

+!start <- !print_hello.                 // ***  uses the package plan


{ include("$jacamo/templates/common-cartago.asl") }
{ include("$jacamo/templates/common-moise.asl") }
----

Notice that the first include gets the plan from the `hello` package, that is downloaded by gradle before the application starts. 

The plan to achieve `start` creates a sub-goal `!print_hello` that is then achieved by the included plan. This latter plan then creates the GUI artifact and shows the message.

It is useful to look at the URL https://jitpack.io/com/github/jomifred/jcm-hello/1.0/build.log (replacing user name) to see the result of building the package from GitHub.
