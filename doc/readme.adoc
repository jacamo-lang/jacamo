The JaCaMo project aims to promote the Multi-Agent Oriented Programming (MAOP) approach by providing a development platform that integrates tools and languages for programming the following dimensions of Multi-Agent Systems: agents, environment, and organisation.

NOTE: See also the community project dedicated to https://github.com/jacamo-lang/documentation/[JaCaMo documentation], the https://jacamo-lang.github.io[JaCaMo web site], and the https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262044578/[JaCaMo book].
