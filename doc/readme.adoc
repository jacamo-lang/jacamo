The JaCaMo project aims to promote the Multi-Agent Oriented Programming (MAOP) approach by providing a development platform that integrates tools and languages for programming the following dimensions of Multi-Agent Systems: agents, environment, and organisation.

NOTE: See also the community project dedicated to https://jacamo-lang.github.io/documentation/[JaCaMo documentation] and the https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262044578/[JaCaMo book].
