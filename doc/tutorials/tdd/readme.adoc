This tutorial explains how to test Jason agents in AgentSpeak, using a novel (as of 2022)
goal-oriented test feature that enables an agent-oriented perspective on automated software testing
and test-driven development. The feature allows writing test programs for Jason agents in
AgentSpeak, and aligns software testing and agent-oriented programming abstractions. This
consolidation of perspectives is called _Goal-Oriented Test-Driven Development_ (GOTDD).

== What is Goal-Oriented Test-Driven Development?
In modern software development, testing plays a key role, as it helps ensure the software works as
expected. Ideally, developers use _Test-Driven Development_ (TDD) approaches, in which a large
portion of the tests is written during or even ahead of the implementation of the actual program
code. The assumption is that specifying the exact desired behavior of a software component before
or alongside the implementation facilitates a more rigorous assessment of the component and ensures
testing is not cut short because of time shortage caused by mis-estimations. Generally, it is
considered good practice to focus automated testing efforts on _unit tests_ of small components that
can and hence _should_ be tested in a rigorous manner and to cover the overall system (or system of
systems) with less dense _integration tests_ and _End-to-End_ (E2E) tests; the latter cannot cover
all possible input and environment configurations because of the explosion in combinatorial options
(even for fairly small systems) but they can potentially catch unexpected behavior of components
that seemingly work correctly from a lower-level perspective.

From an agent-oriented view, unit tests cover behavior that is _agent-agnostic_, _i.e._ which can be
tested as if it was a function/method call -- for example, given the internal state the agent
-- and which is disconnected from the state of the environment and the other agents that (inter)act
in it. While unit tests for agents are conceptually not different from traditional unit tests,
Jason's GOTDD feature is novel even on this level because it provides first-class abstractions for
tests in an agent-oriented programming language. Still, more interestingly, Jason allows for the
specification of tests that check whether an agent, given an initial environment state (and
potentially given other agents), will eventually (or given a specific time constraint) achieve a
particular _goal_; _i.e._, goals are promoted to first-class abstractions for test-driven
development, which allows for integration tests for single agents (agent-environment integration)
and multi agents (agent-environment-agent, whereby the environment may or may not contain explicitly
modelled artifacts) integration. The figure below shows the _test pyramid_ from a traditional
software engineering perspective and contrasts it with an agent-oriented test pyramid.

The tutorial below provides examples of unit testing, single agent testing, and multi-agent testing
with Jason. Note that E2E tests are not covered, because these are typically implemented in a
different technology ecosystem (for example: _Selenium_ for end-to-end user interface testing).
However, we consider E2E MAS testing an interesting open challenge that needs more exploration.

== Under the Hood
Under the hood, Jason's GOTDD feature allows for the instantiation of one main agent per test file,
as well as for the instantiation of several _mock agents_; in addition to mock agents, the main
(to-be-tested) agent may interact with other agents that have been implemented in a traditional
manner. The main agent is monitored by Jason's tester agent with regards to the main agent's ability
to achieve certain goals, or the agent's internal state (for example: belief adoption). Whenever
a corresponding assertion fires, the tester agent reports the result (pass or fail).

== Test Levels in Jason
Now, let us provide examples how tests on the three lower levels (_unit_, _single agent_, _multi
agent_, assuming that end-to-end tests need to be supported by additional tooling) work.
For explanatory purposes, we build a project inspired in an example provided in link:https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262044578/[JaCaMo Book]
of an MAS to control the temperature of a room.

We start discussing current testing approaches that we can use for testing a JaCaMo project. After 
that, we provide an example of a unit test using a JaCaMo test library, then we face slightly more 
challenging situations, testing agent's plans, mocking artifacts and testing agents' interactions.
Each example builds upon its predecessor.

=== Project Setup
Let us set up our JaCaMo project and configure it for GOTDD.

1. First, make sure the `Java 15` or superior is set.

[source]
----
$ java --version
----

2. Then, we download a JaCaMo facility for creating projects and execute it to create our 
`tdd_tutorial` project.

[source]
----
$ curl -s -O http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/np1.1.zip
$ unzip np1.1.zip
$ ./gradlew --console=plain
----

Notice that this creates a sample project with the following source directory structure:

[source]
----
/
- src
    - agt
    - env
    - int
    - org
----

3.  We can run the default project just to make sure everything is working fine. An MAS console 
should open showing our `sample_agent` printing out `hello world`.

[source]
----
tdd_tutorial$ ./gradlew run
----

4. Now, we adapt the sample project to build an agent that controls the temperature of the 
environment. At `src/agt`, we rename the `sample_agent.asl` file to `room_agent.asl`, and fix the 
`tdd_tutorial.jcm` for this other agent filename, as below:

[source]
----
mas tdd_tutorial {

    agent room_agent

}
----

=== Unit Testing in Jason (JaCaMo)
Let us start by implementing a unit test that tests a simple inference rule. In the file 
`room_agent.asl` we replace the default content by the following rule:

[source]
----
now_is_warmer_than(T) :- temperature(C) & C > T.
----

As we can see, the rule checks whether the current 'temperature' is greater than a predefined value. 
A possible method for determining whether this rule is working properly is to begin developing a plan that calls this rule in order to test it in a variety of situations. 
Debugging console messages and other tools such as the link:http://127.0.0.1:3272/[Agents' Inspector] are commonly used.

Following is an example of how this rule can be tested.
Because this rule merely draws inferences and does not act in the environment, we consider
this scenario a *unit testing* scenario rather than a single agent testing scenario.

Now, on the `room_agent.asl` file, we set a temperature value:

[source]
----
temperature(15).
----

Finally, we try out our inference rule:

[source]
----
!auto_test.

+!auto_test:
    temperature(C)
    <- 
    .print("Current temperature: ",temperature(C));

    .eval(X1, now_is_warmer_than(20));
    .print(now_is_warmer_than(20)," = ",X1);

    .eval(X2, now_is_warmer_than(10));
    .print(now_is_warmer_than(10)," = ",X2);

    .eval(X3, now_is_warmer_than(15));
    .print(now_is_warmer_than(15)," = ",X3).
----

This kind of test is performed using the usual command to run a JaCaMo MAS project (`./gradlew run`).
Such *naive* inline tests are frequently used to facilitate debugging, but have obvious
shortcomings:

* They do not allow for a clear separation between test and production code.
* They do not clearly describe desired behavior.
* They make it hard to automate tests.

To test the file properly, we create the file `test_room_agent.asl` at `src/test/jacamo/agt`. To
do so, we can run the following command:

[source]
----
tdd_tutorial$ mkdir -p src/test/jacamo/agt && touch src/test/jacamo/agt/test_room_agent.asl
----

Our source directory structure is now as follows:

[source]
----
/
- src
    - agt
    - env
    - int
    - org
    - test
        - jacamo
            - agt
----

At the beginning of `test_room_agent.asl` file, we import the Jason tester agent, as well 
as the file that we want to test:

[source]
----
{ include("tester_agent.asl") }
{ include("room_agent.asl") }
----

Then, we add a test goal, using the `@[test]` annotation:

[source]
----
@[test]
+!test_now_is_warmer_than
    <-
    !assert_false(now_is_warmer_than(20));
    !assert_true(now_is_warmer_than(10));
    !assert_false(now_is_warmer_than(15)).
----

As we can see, the test specifies the truth table of the inference rule, given the following three
scenarios:

1. The provided value temperature is higher than the current temperature.
2. The provided value is lower than the current temperature.
3. The provided value is equal to the current temperature.

To use this testing facility, we have to make sure the project is using `jacamo:0.10-SNAPSHOT` and
add the following task to our `build.gradle` file:

[source]
----
task testJaCaMo {
    description 'runs JaCaMo unit tests: unit_tests_project.jcm'
    def errorOnTests = false
    outputs.upToDateWhen { false } // disable cache

    doFirst {
        try {
            javaexec {
                main = 'jacamo.infra.JaCaMoLauncher'
                if (gradle.startParameter.logLevel.toString().equals("DEBUG")) {
                    args = ['$jacamoJar/test/jacamo/unit_tests_project.jcm', '--log-conf', '$jasonJar/templates/console-debug-logging.properties']
                } else if (gradle.startParameter.logLevel.toString().equals("INFO")) {

                }
                classpath sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath

                errorOutput = new ByteArrayOutputStream()
                standardOutput = new ByteArrayOutputStream()

                ext.stdout = {
                    return standardOutput.toString()
                }
                ext.errout = {
                    return errorOutput.toString()
                }
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            errorOnTests = true
        }
    }

    doLast {
        def styler = 'black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white'
            .split().toList().withIndex(30)
            .collectEntries { key, val -> [(key) : { "\033[${val}m${it}\033[0m" }] }

        def std = stdout()
        std.splitEachLine('\n') { String line ->
            line = line.replace("TESTING","${styler['yellow']('TESTING')}")
            line = line.replace("PASSED","${styler['green']('PASSED')}")
            line = line.replace("FAILED","${styler['red']('FAILED')}")
            line = line.replace("TODO","${styler['magenta']('TODO')}")
            line = line.replace("LAUNCHING","${styler['blue']('LAUNCHING')}")
            println line
        }

        def err = errout()
        err.splitEachLine('\n') { String line ->
            line = line.replace("TESTING","${styler['yellow']('TESTING')}")
            line = line.replace("PASSED","${styler['green']('PASSED')}")
            line = line.replace("FAILED","${styler['red']('FAILED')}")
            line = line.replace("TODO","${styler['magenta']('TODO')}")
            line = line.replace("LAUNCHING","${styler['blue']('LAUNCHING')}")
            println line
        }

        if (errorOnTests) {
            throw new GradleException('JaCaMo unit tests: ERROR!')
        }
    }
}
tasks.test.finalizedBy testJaCaMo

Now, we test it running the following command:

[source]

$ ./gradlew test --info

=== Single Agent Testing in Jason (JaCaMo)
In the following single agent testing example, we test if the agent cools a room when the
temperature in the room is higher than some specific threshold, _i.e._, the agent *reacts* on
temperature changes, whereas its actions in turn **affect** the temperature in the room.

We keep the rule `now_is_warmer_than/1` of our `room_agent` and now, we implement the cooler functionality that starts the cooler if the temperature is above the
threshold:

[source]
----
+!temperature(T): 
    now_is_warmer_than(T) &
    temperature(C)
    <-  
    if (not state("cooling")) {
        /**
         * To control the room temperature it could  
         * activate a physical cooler here
         */
        +state("cooling");
        .log(warning,C," is too hot -> cooling until ",T);
    }
    !temperature(T).
----


Analogously, the cooler should stop cooling if the temperature is below the threshold:

[source]
----
+!temperature(T):
    state("cooling")
    <-  
    .log(warning,"Temperature achieved: ",T);

    /**
     * Deactivating the cooler
     */
    -state("cooling");

    !temperature(T).
----

Let us highlight that our room_agent example is simplistic from a real-world perspective, as we ignore
the control-theoretical nature of the problem.

Finally, we ensure that the room_agent is continuously evaluating and adjusting its behavior, using the
following loop:

[source]
----
+!temperature(T)
    <-
    !temperature(T).
----

Note that in this example, we specify the initial beliefs of the agent in the
link:./2_room_agent_cooling/tdd_tutorial.jcm[jcm file].

[source]
----
mas tdd_tutorial {

    agent room_agent {
        goals: temperature(10)
        beliefs: temperature(15)
    }

}
----

Also, we want to test whether the agent *acts* correctly. 
So, we add to the file `test_room_agent.asl` at `src/test/jacamo/agt` a new test.
For this, set at target temperature of 10
degrees (given a current temperature of 15 degrees) and regularly check in a loop whether
the cooler acts as expected given the current temperature and the agents's goal:


[source]
----
@[test]
+!test_cool_until_temperature_dropping
    <-
    -+temperature(15); // The default current temperature is 15 degrees
    !!temperature(10); // We want to reach 10 degrees (this is running in parallel)
    .wait(50); // Give some time to the agent to react
    for ( .range(I,1,10) ) { // Let us check 10x if it is cooling correctly
        ?temperature(C);
        if (C > 10) { // Greater than 10, cooler MUST be on
            !assert_true(state("cooling"));
            -+temperature(C-1); // emulate that the temperature has dropped
        } else { // Not greater than 10, cooler MUST be off
            !assert_false(state("cooling"));
        }
    }
    .drop_desire(temperature(10)).
----


The complete project is available link:./2_room_agent_cooling/[here].


=== Agents and Artifacts
In this final single-agent testing example, we introduce an artifact that our agent interacts with.
First,
we configure the MAS in the file `tdd_tutotial.jcm`:

[source]
----
mas tdd_tutorial {
    agent room_agent {
        goals: temperature(21)
        focus: room.hvac
    }

    workspace room {
        artifact hvac: devices.HVAC(15)
    }
}
----
As we can see, our room agent focuses the `hvac` (air conditioning) artifact and has a particular
current temperature (15°C) as it provides to the agent this information. 

The artifact models the air conditioning/HVAC. It has the following methods:

* `init` (with _temperature_ parameter): sets the initial temperature and sets the HVAC's state to
`idle`.

* `updateTemperatureProc` (internal (private), with _step_ parameter): this is used to simulate changes in the room temperature. While the HVAC is not in
state `idle`, change the temperature by `step` degrees and waits for 100ms to then repeat the
loop.

* `startCooling`: sets the state to `cooling` and calls `updateTemperatureProc` with _step_ set to
`-0.5`.

* `stopAirConditioner`: sets the state of the HVAC to `idle`.

The source code of the artifact looks as follows:

[source]
----
package devices;

import cartago.*;

@ARTIFACT_INFO(outports = { @OUTPORT(name = "out-1") })

public class HVAC extends Artifact {

    void init(double initialTemperature){
        defineObsProperty("state","idle");
        defineObsProperty("temperature",initialTemperature);
        log("Temperature: "+getObsProperty("temperature").doubleValue());
    }

    @OPERATION void startCooling(){
        log("startCooling");
        getObsProperty("state").updateValue("cooling");
        this.execInternalOp("updateTemperatureProc",-0.5);
    }

    @OPERATION void stopAirConditioner(){
        log("stopAirCond");
        getObsProperty("state").updateValue("idle");
    }

    @INTERNAL_OPERATION void updateTemperatureProc(double step){
        ObsProperty temp = getObsProperty("temperature");
        ObsProperty state = getObsProperty("state");
        while (!state.stringValue().equals("idle")){
            temp.updateValue(temp.doubleValue() + step);
            log("Temperature: "+temp.doubleValue());
            this.await_time(100);
        }
    }
}
----

Then, we integrate the artifact with our agent, replacing the hard-coded state("cooling")
emulation with actions upon the HVAC artifact.
Note that the code below, is importing **common-cartago.asl**, as it is necessary when the agent interacts with CArtAgO artifacts.

[source]
----
+!temperature(T): 
	now_is_warmer_than(T) &
	temperature(C)
	<-  
	if (not state("cooling")) {
	    startCooling;
		.log(warning,C," is too hot -> cooling until ",T);
    }
	!temperature(T);
.

+!temperature(T):
	state("cooling")
	<-  
	stopAirConditioner;
	.log(warning,"Temperature achieved: ",T);
    !temperature(T);
.

+!temperature(T)
    <-
    !temperature(T);
.

{ include("$jacamoJar/templates/common-cartago.asl") }
{ include("$jacamoJar/templates/common-moise.asl") }
----

The artifact **device/HVAC** is not being instantiated, which means that the external calls **startCooling** and **stopAirConditioner** would break the test if they are executed.
At this time, the main concern regards to the room agent functionalities, not the functionalities of other entities that it interacts with.
To ensure this separation concerns, the **mock** concept can be used.
Here, the **mock** concept is used on the agent under test entity, i.e., we are replacing some agent's plans that calls external actions by plans that are mocking some behaviours.
Notice that the order is very important since each plan is added on the beginning of the plans library of the agent.

[source]
----
@[test] 
+!test_cool_until_temperature_dropping 
	<-
	.add_plan({
	+!temperature(T): state("cooling")
	<-
	-state("cooling");
	!temperature(T);
	}, self, begin);
    /*The next plan must be put on the very top of plans*/
	.add_plan({
	+!temperature(T): now_is_warmer_than(T) & temperature(C)
	<-
	if (not state("cooling")) {
		+state("cooling");
	}
	!temperature(T);
	}, self, begin);

	-+temperature(15);
	!!temperature(10);
	.wait(50);
	for ( .range(I,1,10) ) {
		?temperature(C);
		if (C > 10) {
			!assert_true(state("cooling"));
			-+temperature(C-1);
		} else {
			!assert_false(state("cooling"));
		}
	}
	.drop_desire(temperature(10)).
----

Of course, as we are replacing entire plans, it is a dangerous technique.
Indeed, our tests are not completelly linked to the room agent code.
However, for simplicity we will keep this as an example. 
A safer way could be defining small plans just to call the external actions and just these small plans are mocked.

The complete project is available link:./3_room_agent_with_artifact/[here].

=== Multiple Agents and Agents
Finally, let us implement and test a simple Multi-Agent System (MAS). In the MAS, we have an
additional _assistant agent_ that relays user preferences to the room agent. Accordingly, the code
for the assistant agent is very simple:

[source]
----
+!send_preference:
    preferred_temperature(T) &
    recipient_agent(R)
    <-
    .log(warning,"Sending preference for ",T);
    .send(R,achieve,add_preference(T)).

{ include("$jacamoJar/templates/common-cartago.asl") }
{ include("$jacamoJar/templates/common-moise.asl") }
----

Note that in the `tdd_tutorial.jcm` configuration file, we then instantiate two assistant agents representing
the users _Cleber_ and _Tim_, respectively:

[source]
----
agent tims_assistant : assistant.asl {
        beliefs: preferred_temperature(23)
                 recipient_agent(room_agent)
        goals: send_preference
    }

agent clebers_assistant : assistant.asl {
    beliefs: preferred_temperature(25)
                recipient_agent(room_agent)
    goals: send_preference
}

workspace room {
    artifact hvac: devices.HVAC(25)
}
----

Then, we adjust our room agent so that it considers all preferences received by the assistant agents
to then set its goal temperature to the average of the agents' temperature preferences (of course,
this approach invites strategic manipulation by the users, but let us ignore this issue for the
sake of simplicity):

[source]
----
+!add_preference(T)[source(S)]
    <-
    .abolish(preference(S,_));
    +preference(S,T);
    .findall(X,preference(_,X),L);
    .drop_desire(temperature(_));
    !temperature(math.average(L));
.
----

Now, we can test our agent. However, before we can write the actual tests, we first want to create
some mocks. Note that we have already worked with _mock plans_ in the previous example. 
To test if the the interactions between assistants and the room agent, we opt for we creating the file `test_assistent.asl` at `src/test/jacamo/agt`.
In this file, we test whether the room agent aggregates the preferences of several assistant agents
correctly. This is achieved by instantiating mock agents, this time two assistants with
different temperature preferences and one mock room agent.
[source]
----
@[test]
+!test_multiple_preferences
    <-
    /* 
     * Create a room_agent and two assistants. The assistants
     * ask for 23 and 25 degrees, so the final temperature should
     * be 24 degrees.
     */
    .create_agent(mock_room_agent, "mock_room_agent.asl");
    .create_agent(tims_assistant, "assistant.asl");
    .create_agent(clebers_assistant, "assistant.asl");

    .send(tims_assistant,tell,preferred_temperature(23));
    .send(tims_assistant,tell,recipient_agent(mock_room_agent));
    .send(tims_assistant,achieve,send_preference);
    .send(clebers_assistant,tell,preferred_temperature(25));
    .send(clebers_assistant,tell,recipient_agent(mock_room_agent));
    .send(clebers_assistant,achieve,send_preference);

    /* 
     * Give some time to the room_agent process the information
     * and mocking a result
     */
    .wait(50);
    .send(mock_room_agent,askOne,temperature(T),temperature(T));
    !assert_equals(24,T);

    .kill_agent(mock_room_agent);
    .kill_agent(tims_assistant);
    .kill_agent(clebers_assistant).
----

Notice that the room agent is a mock agent since it will not act as original, it has to have
some plans replaced to avoid code breaks when interacting with the artifact. 
It also must mock the plan that receives preferences and somehow it must provide a way to
check whether it found the average between two specified temperature preferences.
This mock agent is a test accessory. Since it does not have testing plans (it is just a mock), we place this file in the `inc` folder (`src/test/jacamo/inc`).

[source]
----
{ include("room_agent.asl") }

!add_mock_plans.

+!add_mock_plans
	<-
	.add_plan({
	+!temperature(T): state("cooling")
	<-
	-state("cooling");
	!temperature(T);
	}, self, begin);

	.add_plan({
	+!temperature(T): now_is_warmer_than(T) & temperature(C)
	<-
	if (not state("cooling")) {
		+state("cooling");
	}
	!temperature(T);
	}, self, begin);

	.add_plan({ 
	+!add_preference(T)[source(S)]
	<-
	.abolish(preference(S,_));
	+preference(S,T);
	.findall(X,preference(_,X),L);
	/*Mock temperature with the average*/
	+temperature(math.average(L));
	}, self, begin).
----

As we can see, the mock plans do not make calls to the artifact and hence allow for (multi-)agent
testing without artifact instantiation.
