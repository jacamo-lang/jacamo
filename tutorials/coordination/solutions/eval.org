#+TITLE:    Comparison of the different solutions for coordination

Some comparison criteria:
     - what is the basic coordination mechanism?
     - is the coordination inside or outside the agents? Inside => to change the protocol, the code of all agents need to be changed
     - what does the agent need to know before to participate? (language, architecture)?
     - how to find other agents?
     - is the protocol explicitly described somewhere for the agents to "learn" the protocol?
     - is it centralized?
     - what is the performance?

|              |                             |              |              |               |                   |             | + org actions + org perception    |
|              |                             |              |              |               |                   |             |                                   |


Remark: the organization is better for open systems, however it costs something (complexity of the application and performance).

ACL = Agent Communication Language
YP  = Yellow pages

p   = number of participants



[fn:1] several artifacts, one for each auction
[fn:2] the agents still need to know *when* to bid, but some rules of the protocol can be externalized in the artifact
[fn:3] /p/ announce messages, /p/ winner messages (so /2p/), /p/ bids to all participants (so /p^2/)
